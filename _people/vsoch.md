vsoch (pronounced vee-sock) is a Research 
Software Engineer at Stanford University, and an active member of several open
source communities. 

## What Can I Help You With?

I specialize in software engineering, containers, infrastructure development, and 
data processing for computational analyses and workflows. I also have training
(PhD) in machine learning and biomedical informatics. I am eager, responsive,
and excited to help you, and there are many things that you can ask for help with!
Some examples include:

 - help with writing a script
 - developing open source software
 - conducting research on software engineering practices
 - setting up continuous integration
 - building containers
 - using workflow managers
 - installing software

For larger projects, you can support some of my time. I am a part of
the [Stanford Research Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/), and 
would be glad to be rented to help you achieve your goals!
