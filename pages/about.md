Stanford University has a fairly complex [organizational structure](https://uit.stanford.edu/organization/structure),
meaning that Research Software Engineers can be found in the School of Business,
sitting in labs, Research Computing, and as staff in other related departments.
While this does not encompass the entire set, the individuals here represent
a good sampling of the RSE community at Stanford. If you are looking to find
the right source for help at Stanford, check out our [Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/support)
page. If you want to search for a research software engineer, you can
