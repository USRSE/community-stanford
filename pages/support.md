| Cluster | Description |
| :------ |:------------ |
| [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/overview/introduction/) | Is hosted by the [Stanford Research Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu) (SRCC), offering more than 1,000 compute notes, 18,000+ CPU cores, 120TB of total memory, and over 400 GPUs. |
| [SCG Genomics Cluster](https://srcc.stanford.edu/scg-genomics-cluster-genomics-scale) | is offered by the [Stanford Biomedical Informatics Service](http://gbsc.stanford.edu/) with additional support from SRCC. It is used by hundreds of researchers at Stanford. It has 80 compute nodes, with 384 GB to 1.5 TB of RAM, and in total offers 2600+ cores and 9+ PB of storage. There are over 700 software packages ready to go, along with Google Cloud integration. The resource is also NIH dbGaP compliant. |
| [Farmshare](https://web.stanford.edu/group/farmshare/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) | is Stanfordâ€™s community computing environment that is primarily intended for use in coursework, for personal website, and unsponsored research. |
| [Stanford Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/csdcf/computing-environment)| offers services and clusters intended for labs and students in Computer Science, including [SAIL](https://cs.stanford.edu/csdcf/sail-compute-cluster) and [AFS](https://cs.stanford.edu/computing-guide/afs) to share files.|
