## Welcome to the Stanford Research Software Engineer Community!

We represent a subset of the Research Software Engineers that are sitting across
Stanford - whether in the School of Business, individual labs, Research Computing, 
or staff in other related departments, we offer this portal to help grow our community,
and to help direct you to the resource you are looking for. If you are looking to find
the right source for help at Stanford, check out our [Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/support)
page. If you want to search for a research software engineer, you can
[do that too]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/).
