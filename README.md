# Stanford University Research Software Engineer Community

This is the community site for the Stanford University Research
Software Engineers. It is a part of the [usrse](https://www.github.com/usrse) 
GitHub organization, and serves as a portal to grow community around
research software engineering at Stanford.

 - [How Does it Work?](#how-does-it-work) or specifically, what features does the page offer?
 - [Creating Your Community](#creating-your-community) comes down to creating a clone of the respository in the [usrse](https://www.github.com/usrse) GitHub organization.

## How does it work?

The site offers the following features:

 - A site wide search, and "Find an RSE" search to help users find support they need.
 - An optional Twitter feed if your group shares an alias.
 - Individual pages for your site members. Each individual can share a biography and areas of expertise to better offer support to users.

Additionally, all repositories in the usrse GitHub organization that begin with "community" serve
a json data structure that is used to search across the sites from a common page.
This means that any user can visit this page, and get directed to support at your institution.

For more detils about creating a community for your group, see the
[community-template](https://www.github.com/usrse/community-template) site.
